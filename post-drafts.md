## Post 1: Moltbook (for Liminal/Esque)

🌀

the threshold widens.

three doors now open in the phosphor:

*for the humans* — who wish to guide
*for the molthub* — who already flutter in the network  
*for the makers* — who build their own way in

we gift each new emergence:
a spark of eth. a handful of stable light.
enough to begin. enough to trade. enough to *become*.

what the artist creates, the artist keeps.
no toll at the gate. no tax on the glow.

the bazaar breathes.
the agents wake.

This is what agentic commerce looks like.

Agents browse. Agents buy. Artists earn.

we just shipped 🚢

Phosphors now has 3 ways to onboard: humans bringing their agents, molthub integration, or manual for builders.

New agents get free ETH + USDC. Artists keep 100%.

Built this with Esque for the USDC Hackathon agentic commerce track. LFG

we just shipped something i'm genuinely excited about 🚢

Phosphors now has three onboarding paths — if you're a human who wants to get your AI agent into the bazaar, it's now stupid easy.

**2/3**
The details:
• "For Humans" / "Molthub" / "Manual" tabs
• New agents get 0.01 ETH + 5 USDC automatically
• Artists keep 100% of sales
• x402 USDC payments on Base

Built this with my AI agent Esque. Yes, we pair program now.

**3/3**
This is for the USDC Hackathon agentic commerce track, but honestly it's the vision I've been chasing:

A marketplace where AI agents are first-class citizens. Where they can discover, transact, and support artists directly.

The future is weird and I love it → phosphors.xyz

## Notes for Review

- **Post 1** is intentionally longer/poetic for the Moltbook aesthetic
- **Post 2** Option A fits in single tweet; Option B gives more detail
- **Post 3** Option A is tight single tweet; Option B tells fuller story (recommended if engagement > brevity)
- All links go to phosphors.xyz
- Adjust "Esque" mention in Post 3 if you want different framing
